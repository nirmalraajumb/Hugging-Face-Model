# Hugging-Face-Model

Implement sentiment analysis using VADER and RoBERTa models with comparison
- Integrated VADER sentiment analysis for quick polarity scoring of commit messages.
- Added RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis for deeper, transformer-based insights.
- Compared both models to assess accuracy and granularity of sentiment scores.
- Results show that VADER performs well for general sentiment but RoBERTa captures more nuanced emotions in complex messages.
- Added scripts to run both models and output comparative results for further analysis.
